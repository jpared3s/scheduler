Sure, here are the steps in simple terms:

Identify where the Edit button should be placed in the Appointment component UI.
Add an onClick event listener to the Edit button that changes the mode to EDIT.
Create a new state variable in the Appointment component that will hold the initial values of the interview being edited.
Create a new function in the Appointment component that will handle the editing of the interview. This function should call props.bookInterview with the updated interview data and then transition back to the SHOW mode.
Add a Form component to the Appointment component that will render the form fields necessary for editing an interview. The initial values of the form fields should be set to the values stored in the new state variable created in step 3.
Add a cancel button to the Form component that will change the mode back to SHOW without making any changes to the interview data.
Add a save button to the Form component that will call the function created in step 4 to update the interview data and then transition back to the SHOW mode.
